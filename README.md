This repository contains SPOILERS for the Matasano Crypto Challenges.  If you want to complete them yourself, DO NOT view the implementation here.  Matasano have recently announced that they are putting out a book based on the Crypto Challenges, and that therefore it is no longer verboten to post solutions online.

Note that the solutions are in the &lt;number&gt;.py files, the tests are in the &lt;test_number&gt;.py files, the problem descriptions are in the &lt;number&gt;.txt files, and the data are in the &lt;number&gt;\_&lt;sub-number&gt;\_data.txt files.
